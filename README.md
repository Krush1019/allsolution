##Inspiration
Our inspiration for AllSol stemmed from the desire to simplify problem-solving through images. We wanted to create a seamless experience where users could effortlessly upload pictures, annotate them if necessary, and receive tailored solutions instantly

##What it does
AllSol is a one-stop solution-finding application designed to streamline the process of solving problems through images. Users can easily upload pictures from their devices, utilize intuitive annotation tools for better context, and benefit from Gemini AI-powered solution matching.

##How we built it
To build AllSol, we used a combination of Angular for the front-end development, Bootstrap for responsive design elements, and HTML/CSS for structuring and styling the user interface. Additionally, we integrated the Gemini AI API for solution matching.

##Challenges we ran into
One of the main challenges we encountered was optimizing the AI for fast and accurate solution matching. We also focused on refining the annotation tools to provide users a smooth experience while adding context to their images. Additionally, ensuring the scalability and reliability of the backend infrastructure posed its own set of challenges

##Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have developed AllSol into a comprehensive solution-finding platform that combines advanced technology with user-friendly features. Achieving fast and accurate solution matching, refining the annotation tools for optimal usability.

##What we learned
During the development of AllSol, we learned insights into user preferences and behaviors, which informed our decision-making process for feature implementation and usability improvements.

##What's next for AllSol
In the future, we plan to enhance AllSol with additional features and functionalities to further improve the user experience. This includes expanding the database of solutions and integrating feedback mechanisms to continuously improve the platform based on user input.
